## Mission :dart:
I am dedicated to using data to uncover insights, drive decisions, and promote innovation through ethical and accurate analysis. By translating complex information into clear narratives, I aim to empower organizations and communities. I also provide reliable, user-focused technical support with a solutions-first, empathetic approach. Committed to continuous learning, I strive to build resilient IT systems that enhance productivity and trust in technology.

## About Me :man_technologist:
I’m a data-driven educator, researcher, and analyst passionate about using insights to drive impact, growth, and innovation. With a diverse academic background in STEM and hands-on experience in teaching, research, and analytics, I thrive at the intersection of knowledge, purpose, and problem-solving.

Over the years, I’ve contributed to projects that span mathematical modeling, structural analysis, STEM education, and performance evaluation. Each one deepens my commitment to building systems that uplift communities and create opportunities for others. Whether I’m mentoring students, exploring new data tools, or developing strategies, my goal is always the same: to inspire, empower, and leave a lasting legacy of excellence.

Driven by resilience, curiosity, and a desire to be a better version of myself, I continue to grow, share, and lead with purpose.
  

I’m currently:  
- 🔭 Working on **Maji Ndogo Water Services Quality and Infrastructure** aimed to identify the water sources people use and determine both the total and
    average number of users for each source, and to examine the duration citizens typically spend in queues to access water.  
- 📊 Communicate our findings Visually.
